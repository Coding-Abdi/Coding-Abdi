Hi, I'm Abdi and I have just completed a 16-week Tech bootcamp with the School of Code. My time with the School of Code has confirmed my suspicions â€“ the tech world offers challenging and fun problems that can be solved with creativity, resilience, and teamwork.

The past 16 weeks have provided me with a solid grasp of the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, amongst others, and I canâ€™t wait to join a company that will allow me to add value to their organization in an environment that ensures that I can continue my tech learning journey.

Skills: REACT / JS / HTML / CSS

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on securing my first role in Tech 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript and React
