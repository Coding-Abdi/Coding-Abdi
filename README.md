### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Abdi. I wanted to be a lawyer, so I studied law. I interned at a law firm, realised that their IT team were doing really interesting work, were paid well and took the concept of work/life balance seriously. I graduated last summer, and promptly switched my allegiance to Tech. 

I have just completed a 16-week Tech bootcamp with the School of Code. My time with the School of Code has confirmed my suspicions â€“ the tech world offers challenging and fun problems that can be solved with creativity, resilience, and teamwork. 

The past 16 weeks have provided me with a solid grasp of the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, amongst others, and I canâ€™t wait to join a company that will allow me to add value to their organization in an environment that ensures that I can continue my tech learning journey.
